        <h3>About the App</h3>
        <p>SitterSwap lets families connect to each other to find the best child care for their little ones. It replaces those large, inpersonal child care websites and expands your pool of child care options based on trusted relationships.</p>

        <h3>My Role</h3>
        <p>I created this app during a one week, solo sprint. I focused on creating solid data models for users and families to manage the various relationships a user would have with each family and each other through roles like sitter.</p>

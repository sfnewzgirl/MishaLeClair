        <h3>About the App</h3>
        <p>"Within Reach" is a mobile-friendly app for people who rely on Dialectical Behavior Therapy as part of their recovery process. The goal is to make the hard work of recovery easy, accessible, and private. Users can create guided entries that walk them through the core principles of DBT techniques including mindfulness, emotion regulation, and distress tolerance. The app allows users to share those entries with a chosen mental health professional to further aid in their recovery.</p>
        <h3>My Role</h3>
        <p>"Within Reach" is my app idea and I served as team leader during this one week, group sprint. During the project, I was responsible for building models, views, controllers, and routes.</p>

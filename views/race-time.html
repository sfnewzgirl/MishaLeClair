        <h3>About the App</h3>
        <p>A two player race against the clock. When a player clicks the "Ready to Play?" button, a countdown begins. Players are given 30 seconds to rack up the most clicks. Player 1 uses the "A" key and player 2 uses the "L" key.</p>
        <h3>My Role</h3>
        <p>I built this game over one weekend as a exercise in jQuery and timing. I created a countdown for players with text displaying "ready, set, go". Also, I used keyup as the event listener so a player wouldn't be able to hold a key down and rack up points quickly as well as to avoid a tie if two players simply held their keys down.</p>

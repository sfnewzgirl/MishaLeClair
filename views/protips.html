        <h3>About the App</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>The ProTips App and API offers theme park visitors easy access to trip planning and crowdsourced advice they can't easily get elsewhere. While many resources describe rides, attractions and services (many even rate those), inevitably the best advice comes from another park visitor who has been there many times before and has a wealth of knowledge to share. Users can read ProTips, write their own, and vote up or vote down on a specific ProTip. Users can also comment on a ProTip to add their spin, additional information or even let other users know that ProTip is now outdated.</p>

        <h3>My Role</h3>
        <hr>
        <p> worked extensively on the server side and database during this pair project - creating schemas, models, RESTful routes and server-side functions. For example, users vote up or down with separate button clicks on the front end that are sent through AJAX calls to the server, where a JavaScript function updates the database to persist the value.</p>
